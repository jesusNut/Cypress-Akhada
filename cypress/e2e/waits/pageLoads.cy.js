//! HOW DO I WAIT FOR MY APPLICATION TO LOAD? 

//* When you load your application using cy.visit(), Cypress will wait for the load event to
//* fire. The cy.visit() command loads a remote page and does not resolve until all of the 
//* external resources complete their loading phase. Because we expect your applications to observe
//* differing load times, this command's default timeout is set to 60000ms.
//* If you visit an invalid url or a second unique domain, Cypress will log a verbose yet friendly error message.

//! Cypress automatically takes care that the Web page is completely loaded via cy.visit(),cy.go(),cy.reload() etc.
//! before executing any command.

//! ****** default pageLoadTimeout is 60 seconds i.e. 60000 ms.

    });

    it('visit a slow loading website with 0 sec ', () => {

        cy.get('body>section>div>h3').should('have.text', 'Load Delays');
